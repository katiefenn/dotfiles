	WIP: Begin to add support for configurable destination URL
	
	# This is the commit message #2:
	
	feat: Consolidate AWS S3 buckets into single bucket for Spark Clips
	
	- Adds support to host raw videos, optimised videos and poster images in
	  a single S3 bucket instead of three separate S3 buckets
	- This change is also maintains compatibility with Ovide, by deriving
	  the bucket name, region and upload path from a full S3 URL rather than
	storing these settings separately.
	- The AWS access key id and secrets will also be consolidated to allow
	  Ovide and Spark Clips to upload images and videos using a common set
	of auth keys
	
	# This is the commit message #3:
	
	Migrate podcast images
	
	# This is the commit message #4:
	
	WIP: Try S3 Urls instead
	
	# This is the commit message #5:
	
	feat: Add support for grouping and credentials
	
	- Adds support for the Zencoder API grouping and credentials properties.
	- Grouping allows us to segregate jobs for different projects - e.g,
	  Ovide and Spark Clips. We're hoping to use this to differentiate
	between the two for billing and reporting purposes.
	- Credentials allows us to choose which AWS credentials Zencoder should
	  use to upload finished videos to S3 - this will be useful when
	Zencoder starts encoding videos for both Ovide and Spark Clips
	- Also tidies up all the logging messages to make them more descriptive
	  and more consistent.
	
	# This is the commit message #6:
	
	Revert to HTTP-based destination URLs
	
	# This is the commit message #7:
	
	Make optimised media files destination configurable
	
	# This is the commit message #8:
	
	Fix upload path for bucket root uploads
